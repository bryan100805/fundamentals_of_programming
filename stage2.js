/*
This program will ask for user's name then reveals a main menu with an option of 1-7. 
The first option of the main menu displays all membersâ€™ details. 
The second option of the main menu displays selected member's details.
The third option of the main menu adds a new member, his or her date of birth, date joined and the default membership type to the membership data.
The fourth option of the main menu update the member's points and their membership type.
The fifth option of the main menu displays a submenu with option 1-6 for the user to choose from.
The sixth opton of the main menu withdraw the existing member from the membership data and displays the remaining members left in the membership program.
The seventh option of the main menu terminates the program.
First option of submenu displays all the members who have a particular membership type.
Second option of submenu displays the youngest and the oldest members of the membership data.
Third option of submenu displays the members with the highest and lowest points earned.
Fourth option of submenu displays the total number of members in each membership type.
Fifth option of submenu displays the total points in each membership type.
Sixth option of submenu returns to the main menu.
